I'm actually making an exciting amount of progess towards my demo and it's only been a day. I know I'll plateau when I really get into it,
and I'm only in the [greybox](http://www.neilblevins.com/art_lessons/greybox/greybox.htm) phase, but I'm immediately infatuated with the 
malleability of 3d objects in Unity (particulary using [ProBuilder](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder%40latest/&ved=2ahUKEwjAkNydzpaSAxXzkmoFHboiONwQFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1RD8FlboipFlgkzjWpthfq)).

## Design Principles
“Absolutely no AI was used to create assets, write code, write or create content in this game.”
“Find the guys who the guys you look up to, look up to”
“I will never show what I can imply.” (this applies to diegetic ui and character skin etc.)
“I will never scare when I can disturb.”
“I will never rush when I can suffocate.”


## Spring Semester
Started my courses this semester with Enterprise Cloud Computing (ECC) taking most of the time. I'm also taking Data Mining and Predictive Modeling, an upper level Data Science course, Game Dev in Unity, and Web Technologies. 

We've been using "Essentials of Cloud Computing" Second Edition, and it's an asynch class so that thing's pretty much my teacher. Boy are there a lot of full circle moments happening though as it pertains to the state of Computer Science in university. After taking like 40 pages of notes though, I don't wanna write about it anymore, but expect posts on IAM, a LEMP stack I plan to put on a VPC, and all sorts of other fun junk like terraforming and adding CI/CD to the server once it is being used for something.

### Dev Log
After taking the dimensions of our newly finished attic, I then modeled all but the trapezoidal roof and window cavities. I even have the roof faces modeled but my brain went straight to using what I picked up from the attic practice for implementing a class project as soon as I had to add angles to the equation teehee. 

I implemented a fair bit with just the UI and generated a script for some vertex tooling because (as I learned the hard way) Unity isn't CAD. I have a room done, as well as some more original narrative set piece stuff blocked out at this point. As for actually writing code for playing with it, I learned my first bit of C# today when writing a monoscript for some animation set sample objects from unity asset store. There's no idle anim, so my robot guy runs in place, and then runs forward, and then kinda runs forward... backward. So no ideal, but it's free. After looking at the complexity of the animated robot (kyle) I decided that I'm ready to outsource animations for the most part (if allowed by prof).

A long time ago (years at least) I watched a few seconds of a clip from a Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie. I've now (very carefully as to not watch it) discovered that it's from the film Kairo (Pulse). As a person who's seen a lot of scary movies, and spent many nights in complete darkness, headphones blasting while playing Outlast or Deadspace, I think I am somewhat of an authority when I say -- it's kind of scary. I've seen enough of the clip to never see the rest, and the little bit I saw taught me in a more frutiful way than ever that in horror, less is more. It's not gory (at least from what I know), it's not sacrilegeous or a spooky creature, it's a woman at the end of a room from down a long hallway. We see her from the perspective of a man at the opposite end of a (oddly wide and tall room, that is shot oddly wide..ly) very long space. To encapsulate what happens in a line: We are forced to watch as she comes towards him, and every second is like watching a car accident but worse. I won't go beyond that, be braver than me and go watch it (I was only a boy when it scarred me, give me a break). 

Anyway, the takeaway is to make rooms 10-15% larger than they should be in my levels, and to make sight lines almost too long. I think I'm going to develop the AI to fit the environment rather than the other way around as well. Normally horror AI have a cone for far and narrow vision, wide and short, and so close they can touch you 360 degree. I might just play with that and find a non traditional route. I also think that the client-server N-tiered distributed model is weirdly analogous to the way the AI is written for Alien Isolation, and want to play with those concepts in design as well.
