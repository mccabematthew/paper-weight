It's actually pretty sweet and easy to use, alliteration is just funny. <!--more-->
First of all, I've never used toml and struggled for 45 minutes to figure out that my pages
weren't displaying because I was using colons rather than equals to set menu parameters. toml
stands for tom's obvious markup language. I am dumb. I also struggled to understand the code
flow of hugo, but after starting and playing with a few new themes I've learned that the 
documentation and robust template options make it ridiculously easy to use. The learning curve
after day one was actually not that bad at all, though I doubt I'll be writing many templates 
for the time being.

Also, I made a list of projects that I'm gonna build in the next 4 1/2 months:

1. Farevoyant (with Cobra and Hugo Frontend)
2. FOSS Go binary with goreleaser + CI/CD
3. A few sites
  - Coda Website (personal business hub)
  - Curriculum Vitae
  - Paper Weight 
  - A site akin to [This One](https://brucewaynex.com/) (as a toe dip into real web dev)
  - Maybe a landing page for my brother
  - Maybe a save the date site for my other brother
  - Probably a site for unity game if I'm able to make shippable MVP by May
  - Sites for each NP trip that I go on
4. Market Analytics RDBMS
5. Portfolio Backtesting Engine
6. FOSS Bash Scripts
7. Systems and Applied Analytics Project (undecided)
8. Unity game (for a class I'm taking)
9. And probably more...

Thanks for reading! The purpose of this is to learn and honestly get a dopamine drip for some
of the stuff that takes awhile to be tangible.
