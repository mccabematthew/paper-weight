tl;dr Texans stomped steelers, I refuse to use build things on windows through GUIs.

## Windows, Resentment

I continually run into tangential windows or VS Code or PS issues when trying to actually build on windows.
I don't plan on using windows for any application building, mostly just DSA's. All my network programming will be on arch (thank God),
so I say screw it -- I'm using arch for producing things and windows for sandbox stuff (maybe a container or prob WSL for schoolwork, but idk). 
I've spent two day's solving new problems for things that I'm already familiar with on arch, so why would I spend the time on windows when I'll 
be using zsh professionaly on a mac anyway.

## Football, Resentment

Steelers are so bad it's actually unbelievable. D.K. put on his best [A.J. Brown Impression](https://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1qbekm3/highlight_dk_metcalf_drops_a_gimme/) at (what I think) ended up being one of the most
consequential plays of the game. After the first big turnover, when we had  momentum, the lead, and were in houston territory... he got butterfingers
on a gimme. We suck though, so after losing momentum -- and C.J. Stroud more than DOUBLING his regular season turnovers -- we failed to capitalize 
in literally any way. This was one of the hardest earned losses I've ever watched. 

To cap off the depressing state of Pittsburgh ball, Aaron Rodgers possibly ended his career last night on a pick six. I wanna crawl in a hole and die.
Freiermuth had a pretty great catch when he finally got a target though, you're my boy muth.
