## New Blog Idea
Shooting fancy ideas into the black whole of the internet is cool but feels self aggrandizing. That doesn't mean I'll stop because:

1. I'm self aggrandizing
2. No one will read these because of how long and awful they are ;)

That being said a more productive (or at least structured) idea came to mind... productivity-centric blogs. I cook almost daily so why not record the shot-in-the-dark chances I take while breaking tried and true recipes. Blindly tossing -- what is clearly too much -- paprika into ground beef before putting in the taco mix is a lesson that I'm stupid enough to not learn from.

More importantly its good for the portfolio and signals characteristic ambition and productivity to whatever principal engineer will be looking at my portfolio 8 years from now. Then he'll throw a sack with a big dollar sign on it at me and I'll prance whimsically into the distant horizon as the chorus of careless whisper plays. Man I'm bored rn.


## Daily Skill Checks
I also pathologically start new things, and when they stick it's cool. But
they don't always stick. Hopefully that principal engineer stopped reading 
at the neurotic money sack part.

I'm doing DSA problems daily now. My goal isn't even to solve them as much as it
is to develop a strategy for determining what step to take until I have a solution. So the past couple of day's I've just been working through the:

- brute force
- suboptimal
- optimal
- out of the box (hereafter referenced as OOTB)

solutions to a single problem until I can sit down and understand its time and space complexity, and the tradeoffs of the sub optimal and OOTB paths. For one thing, this has genuinely made me less anxious about approaching problems with rich complexity, but it also helps me to step through these granular problems as if they are (or are at least modules of) systems themselves. Watch out CV, theres a new domain page comin your way!

In truth its probably at best a vehicle for me to have practical implementation practice in go, because I hardly use it with hugo and have to level up before writing any protocols or (actual) infra system submodules. Exciting nonetheless. I should aim to make this more organized as a pure technical and Italian blog from now on tbh, we'll see.
