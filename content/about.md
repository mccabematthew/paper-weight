Paper Weight is a blog with a single purpose:
 1. **Writing down what I Learn**

Basically it's a trash basket for me to shoot crinkled up notes after implementing
things that I think I would forget, or [*rubber duck debugging*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) 
for the sake of learning. I lied about the single purpose, it's also here for me to fart around when I'm bored, to learn hugo 
by writing components to extend my web sites, to shoot the breeze about my budget and diet, and to show pictures and stuff cuz readin is 4 lozers.
